# Antugrow - Reputation Based DeFi Lending Protocol for Farmers

## Overview
A DeFi protocol for secure lending to unbanked farmers, collateralized by their farms as Real World Assets. 

The platform digitizes farm records into Verifiable Credentials ("Badges") for credit scoring and lending decisions.

Through Antugrow, farmers are supported to uphold best practices for maximum yields while Investors get access to a trusted path for deployment of investment.

## EthSafari Hackathon 2024
In line with the theme of creating Africa's innovations, Antugrow's vision is to Connect Capital to any farmer in the World.

This project aims to provide a system for farmers to obtain verifiable credentials based on their farm activities. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that the credentials are secure, tamper-proof, and easily accessible.

## Features
The solution features the Antugrow Farmer's mobile app for secure management of farm data (SSI), and an investment module for channeling crypto liquidity and conversion of the same to fiat (M-PESA). General features include:

- **Verifiable Credentials**: Farmers can receive credentials that validate their activities and achievements based on the W3C VC open standard.
- **Privado ID Integration**: Utilizes Privado ID SDK to store and verify credentials while maintaining data privacy through Zero Knowledge Proofs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for farmers to manage their credentials.
- **OnchainKit by BASE**: Toolkit to manage the investment module and Smart Contracts deployment via BASE.
